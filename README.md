# FlowPattern-EDDenseNet

This repository contains the implementation of the ED-DenseNet model for gas-liquid two-phase flow pattern recognition.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains sample images for different flow patterns.
- `models/`: Includes the model architecture definitions.
- `scripts/`: Training and prediction scripts.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and loss definitions.

## Dataset

Due to institutional confidentiality policies, the full dataset cannot be made publicly available. However, a representative subset of images is provided in the `data/` directory. For access to the complete dataset, please contact the corresponding author.

## Usage

1. **Training the model:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py
